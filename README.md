# polynomial_program
Purpose:
This programming assignment exercises dynamic memory allocation, pointer operations, and copy constructor design through designing a doubly-linked circular list with a dummy header to implement an ADT polynomial.
A Sparse Polynomial Implementation Using A List

The ADT polynomial stores only the terms with nonzero coefficients. For example, you can represent the polynomial p1 = -3x7 + 4x3 + 9 as follows. (nonnegative exponents)
